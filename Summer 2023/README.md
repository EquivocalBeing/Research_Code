I created these codes while doing an internship through Saint Martin's University in Lacey, WA

During the internship, I was in charge of finding the elemental abdundances of stars in and around globular clusters.
This was to see if globular cluster were getting stripped apart.

Some of the codes are used to find these abdundances, whiles some are to analysis the data and comparing it to other known data.
