I wrote these codes while interning at LIGO Hanfod as a Caltech SURF student, then as an University of Oregon Research Student Intern.

Two of the codes are intended to analysis data field data from a magnetometer and seismometer.
The other two are used to calibrate equipment
There is also some lab data which can be used to run the code
