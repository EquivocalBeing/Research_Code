These are codes I wrote during my time at LIGO as a Caltech SURF student and later on as a undergaduate research intern for the University of Oregon. 

There are a couple different versions of the same code. However, the most up to date version would be the ce_analysis_code

These code are intended to analysis field data from a magnetometer and a seismometer.
